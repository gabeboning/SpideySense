SpideySense
=========

Herein lives all of the code for SpideySense.

SpideySense is a touch sensor composed of small individual modules, leaving users free to rearrange them at any time. The sensor is zero-depth (no space needed for a camera, or anything like that),  requires no physical pressure to be triggered (like resistive) and will detect all objects (unlike capactive).

An Arduino drives the hardware component, and communicates with Processing to draw the images, process them, and output meaningful touch data through TUIO.
